- **Color Palette:** Grayscale design (gray-50 to gray-900)

## Key Design Decisions Made

### 1. Grayscale First Approach
- **Decision:** Use grayscale palette instead of Lavanda brand colors
- **Reasoning:** Focus on layout and content structure first
- **Status:** Ready for brand colors to be added strategically later

### 2. White Header Design
- **Decision:** Changed from dark header to white with dark text
- **Reasoning:** Cleaner, more modern appearance, better logo contrast
- **Implementation:** `bg-white text-gray-900` with `border-b border-gray-200`

### 3. Custom UI Mockups
- **Decision:** Create detailed CSS/SVG UI mockups for each persona
- **Reasoning:** Show actual product interfaces rather than generic descriptions
- **Implementation:** Custom CSS classes for dashboards, chat interfaces, analytics panels

### 4. Consistent CTA Strategy
- **Decision:** Persona-specific call-to-action buttons
- **Implementation:** "Talk to [Persona] Expert" + "See [Persona Tool] in Action"

## Content Strategy

### Messaging Framework
- **Hero Headlines:** Problem-focused, outcome-driven
- **Value Props:** Specific to each persona's KPIs and challenges
- **Social Proof:** Industry-specific testimonials and metrics
- **Technical Depth:** Appropriate level of detail for each audience

### UI Mockup Strategy
Each persona page includes 4-5 detailed UI mockups showing:
- Actual product interfaces (dashboards, chat, analytics)
- Workflow processes (timelines, funnels, automation)
- Data visualization (charts, metrics, reports)
- Integration examples (APIs, ERPs, external tools)
